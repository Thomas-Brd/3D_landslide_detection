# 3D landslide detection
![](figures/final_inventory.png)
This repository contains the code used in Bernard et al. (2021) and a jupyter notebook of the 3D point cloud differencing workflow.

## Requierements
Software : Cloudcompare (V2.11 or later) : http://cloudcompare.org/

- pandas V1.1.5 or later
- numpy V1.19.5 or later
- laspy V1.7.0 : https://pypi.org/project/laspy/
- jupterlab V3.0.1 or later

## Data 

* The original pre-earthquake LiDAR can be found at: http://dx.doi.org/10.5069/G9G44N75 
* The original post-earthquake data can be accessible upon request from https://canterburymaps.govt.nz/about/feedback/.
