# 3D landslide detection
![](figures/3D_landslide_detection.png)
This repository contains the dataset used in Bernard et al. (2020) and a jupyter notebook of the automatic workflow.

## Requierements
Software : Cloudcompare (V2.11 or later) : http://cloudcompare.org/

## Data 
Data used in Bernard et al.(2020) are located in the "Data/" folder. It contains:
* The landslide source and deposit informations 

The LiDAR data including our study area are accessible at: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4011607
* Original pre-earthquake LiDAR can be found at: http://dx.doi.org/10.5069/G9G44N75 
* Original post-earthquake data can be accessible on request.  

(All LiDAR data are under license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/)

The M3C2 parameters files are in the "Landslide_detection/" folder. 

The point cloud of the detected significant changes with fluvial erosion and sedimentation filtered is also provided.

## Getting started
The 3D landslide detection workflow can be executed from the jupyter notebook "3D_landslide_detection" or from the cloudcompare software directly.
